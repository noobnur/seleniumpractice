Learning points
1. When looking for the chromedriver.exe, just download the latst zip and link to it as "/path/chromedriver" and not "/path/chromedriver.exe"
2. When getting the variable to test against, be sure when you should be setting the variable. My test failed because the sample code set the variale for the title before the google search was made.
